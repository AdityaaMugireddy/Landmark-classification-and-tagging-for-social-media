This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a landmark classifier. It addresses the challenge of inferring location data for images lacking metadata, a common scenario in photo sharing services. By automatically detecting and classifying landmarks, this project streamlines the user experience. The process involves data preprocessing, training CNNs, and deploying the best model as an app
